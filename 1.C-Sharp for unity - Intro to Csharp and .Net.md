I'll be honest with you: the first little while that you are learning to program can be a bit tedious and boring. The simple programs that we'll be creating at first will be very dull compared to the stuff you'll be making afterward. But it is an important step. You need to learn to walk before you can learn to run.
## Introduction 

**C#** was developed by **Microsoft** in the early 2000s as a key part of the **.NET Framework**.
**Internal development of .NET** began in the late 1990s, It was crafted as a modern, object-oriented language designed to rival Java. C# took the best elements from C++ and Java, integrating their strengths while overcoming some of their drawbacks. With a focus on **simplicity**, **performance**, and **developer productivity**, C# quickly became a go-to language for building a wide range of applications, from desktop software to web services and games. **Initially, it only supported Windows, as the .NET Framework was designed specifically for Windows-based applications.**


***c# vs .net framework***
- **C#** is a programming language 
- **.Net framework** is the platform that enables your code to run

"Think of **C#** as the "recipe" and **.NET Framework** as the "kitchen" where you prepare the dish"

### .NET  implementations 

**.NET Implementations** refer to the different versions and adaptations of the .NET ecosystem designed to run on various operating systems and platforms. These implementations allow developers to create applications that can run on different devices and environments. Each implementation serves a specific purpose, addressing the needs of different application types, such as desktop, web, mobile, or cloud applications.

- **[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)**: The original implementation of .NET, developed by Microsoft, primarily for Windows-based applications. It provides a comprehensive set of libraries and tools for building Windows desktop applications and web applications through ASP.NET.

- **[.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1)**: A cross-platform, open-source implementation of .NET designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It was built to enable developers to create applications that can run on multiple platforms without modification, focusing on performance and scalability.

- **[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)**: The unified version of .NET, starting from .NET 5, which combines the best features of .NET Framework and .NET Core into one platform. It is cross-platform and open-source, providing support for a wide variety of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, and cloud-based solutions.

- **[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/)**: An open-source implementation of .NET, **Mono** provides the **runtime environment** for executing C# code. designed to bring .NET applications to different platforms such as mobile devices (including iOS and Android) and gaming consoles. It is widely used with **Unity** for game development and for cross-platform mobile applications.

**Mono** was initially developed by **Xamarin**, a company that later became part of **Microsoft** in 2016. Xamarin's acquisition by Microsoft allowed Mono to become a core component of their cross-platform mobile development framework, **Xamarin**, which enables developers to create native applications for iOS, Android, and other platforms using C#.

## .NET Compilation Process

Running C# code: 
***To run a C# code you need two main components*** 

1. Compiler
2. Runtime Environment 

#### Compiler 

* Translates **C# source code** into an intermediate format called **Intermediate Language (IL)** or **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**.
* **Compiler for C#:** `csc` (C# Compiler), which is part of the **.NET SDK**
* **Output:** Generates an assembly file (e.g., `.exe` or `.dll`)

Two main Compilers [CSC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms379563(v=vs.80)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) 

| Feature                     | `csc` (Classic)                      | Roslyn (Modern)                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                 | Original C# compiler                 | Modern, open-source C# compiler                                  |
| **Introduced**              | .NET Framework 1.0                   | .NET Framework 4.5+ (2015)                                       |
| **Platform**                | Windows (mostly)                     | Cross-platform (via .NET SDK)                                    |
| **.NET Versions Supported** | .NET Framework (up to 4.x)           | .NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET 5/6/7                            |
| **C# Language Versions**    | Supports older C# versions (1.0–5.0) | Supports newer C# versions (6+)                                  |
| **Tooling**                 | Basic compiler                       | Rich tooling with diagnostics, IntelliSense, and IDE integration |
| **Runtime Integration**     | Tied to .NET Framework runtime       | Tied to .NET Core/.NET runtime                                   |
| **Use Cases**               | Legacy Windows applications          | Modern .NET applications, IDEs, and build systems                |
| **Open Source**             | No                                   | Yes (part of .NET Foundation)                                    |

#### Runtime Environment 
---
- Executes the compiled IL code by converting it to native machine code using the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**.
- Converts IL to native machine code via **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation
- Manages **memory** (e.g., garbage collection).



- **C# Source Code** (`.cs`):
    - This is the C# code you write (e.g., `Program.cs`).
```c#
using System;

public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, IL!");
    }
}

```

- **C# Compiler** (Roslyn or `csc`):
    
    - The **C# compiler** (either **Roslyn** for .NET Core or **`csc`** for .NET Framework) **compiles** the C# code into **Intermediate Language (IL)**.
    - **IL code** is **not bytecode**. It's a set of platform-agnostic instructions (much like assembly language) that the **.NET runtime** can understand.
    - The **output** is an **EXE** or **DLL** file that contains this IL code.
- **IL Code**:
    - **IL (Intermediate Language)** is a low-level language that's not tied to a specific hardware or operating system.
    - It's stored in **DLL** or **EXE** files.
    - It can be thought of as a **higher-level assembly language** that's meant to be processed by the runtime.
IL code 
```c#
.assembly extern mscorlib { }
.assembly HelloWorld { }
.module HelloWorld.exe
.namespace HelloWorld
{
    .class public auto ansi beforefieldinit HelloWorld
        extends [mscorlib]System.Object
    {
        .method public hidebysig static void Main() cil managed
        {
            .entrypoint
            // Code size       17 (0x11)
            .maxstack  1
            IL_0000:  ldstr      "Hello, IL!"
            IL_0005:  call       void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
            IL_000a:  nop
            IL_000b:  ret
        } // end of method HelloWorld::Main
    } // end of class HelloWorld
}
```

- **CLR**:

    - The **CLR** (in .NET Framework) or **CoreCLR** (in .NET Core/5/6+) is the runtime that loads and executes the **IL code**.
    - The runtime provides services like **memory management**, **garbage collection**, and **type safety**.
    - Just like Java applications require the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** to run, .NET applications need the **.NET Runtime**, which includes the CLR, libraries, and supporting tools.

- **JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time Compilation)**:
    
    - The **CLR uses a JIT compiler** to **translate the IL code** into **native machine code** (specific to the platform) when the program is running (at runtime).
    - This is where IL code gets translated into something that can be executed on the specific platform's processor (like Intel, ARM, etc.).
- **Native Code**:

    - This is the **machine code** that your CPU can execute directly. It’s the result of the **JIT compilation** process.



| **Platform**       | **Compiler**                               | **Runtime**                     | **JIT Compilation**             | **Output**        | **Key Notes**                                                                |
